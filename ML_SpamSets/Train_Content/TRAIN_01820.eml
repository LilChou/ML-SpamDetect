 Are you using `exactly' (in some sense) the same config?

 it's a simple reproduction of this bug:

 
 i've got the same problem either on lenny/squeeze/sid and all possibl=
e
 kernels up to 2.6.34 (not tested yet). can someone tell mi how to
 send a bug report in that case? launchpad service seems little
 easier since it doesn't reqiure exact package ;)

 thanks in advance and all the best
