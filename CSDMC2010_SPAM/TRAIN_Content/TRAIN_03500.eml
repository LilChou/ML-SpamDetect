Re: [Semi-OT] Accessing gmail from Python





 I already know how to use the "regular" POP3 class, which I use on a
 semi-regular basis for examining/zapping mails which fetchmail barfs on.
  I've Googled my fingers off, but there are no hints as to what the keyfile
 and certfile are.


maybe this link can help
