Package              : python-clamav
Version              : 0.4.1-1.1~volatile1 (Lenny)
Importance           : medium

python-clamav, which provides Python bindings to ClamAV, a virus scanning
engine, needed a recompilation with the newer clamav 0.95.3.  If you use
python-clamav directly or through nautilus-clamscan, we strongly recommend
you to upgrade to this version, as the old version the package was linked
against stopped working.

to your /etc/apt/sources.list:
