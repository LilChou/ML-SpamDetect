How to use NB.py:
   Invoke the script by command: python3 NB.py

Then the program will take the files that were generated by ExtractContentRefined.py
and do all the works for you.

It will calculate the probabilities of words' occurance under the situation of spam
and the probabilities of words' occurance under the situation of ham.

Then classify the Training set by comparing the product of the overall words' probability
and then output the number of True Positive, False Positive, True Negative, False Negative
False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate, Recall, Precision, F-Score

Do the same thing to the Testing set and show the outputs as well.
